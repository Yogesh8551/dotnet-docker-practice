# ðŸš€ Dockerized .NET WebApp (DevOps Practice)

This project is a simple ASP.NET Core web application that I successfully **Dockerized** and ran locally as part of my DevOps practice.

##  What I did

- Built & published a .NET 8 webapp
- Created a **Dockerfile**
- Built a Docker image using `docker build`
- Ran the container using `docker run`
- Accessed the application in the browser at `http://localhost:8000`
